# Simulation-Study-for-Covariance-matrix-estimation-under-Stein-loss
Monte Carlo Simulations for the PRIAL of the Haff-type estimator

We can simulate the real covariance matrix in different ways(Identity, Block...) 
We can also construct the real covariance matrix from the real data. In the folder "OriginalData", it's a dataset of stock prices for 20 tickers. With R, we compute their daily log returns for 50 trading days, and its sample covariance matrix will be the real convariance matrix for our simulations.
